This is a basic App that will log date and temperature as key-value pairs in a map within a object called 'Unit'. The idea is that 'Unit' represents a freezer- or fridge unit that holds
logs of temperature in celcius degrees at given time/date. 

There is implemented function that prints the content of the map, and it will also warn if the temperature that trying to be printed is below a certain treshold. This is currentlly only 
noticed by a print statement inside the console.
